                To: My Koala 💌
                <p>From: The Luckiest Guy in the World</p>


Hey love,
Today marks one whole year of us being us. 365 days, and not a single one has gone by without me being thankful for having you in my life.
Mujhe aj vhi yad ha, Wo first time jab tum hasi mujhe deckh kar, and how my heart knew—this is it. 
This is the girl who’s going to flip my world upside down... in the most beautiful way.
Meri gudiya, apke sath rehna is a dream for me , and mujhe ush dream se jagna nahi ha esa dream.
 Your laughter is my favorite sound, your eyes my favorite view, and your heart—my favorite home.
  I can’t explain how much you mean to me in just words, but I hope this letter gets close.
My cutie, I love how you hug like you never want to let go, and kese tum randomly bolti ho
“I love you” at the perfect moment, and how even your silence feels like the sweetest music to me. 
You’ve been my strength, my peace, my adventure, and my calm—all at once.
Babe, I know relationships aren’t always easy. We’ve had our ups and downs, our late-night calls, our silly fights, 
our cuddles, and our deep talks. But even in the hardest moments, there was never a single second where I didn’t love you. 
Loving you has been the easiest, most natural thing I’ve ever done.
And my koala... I call you that because, like a koala, you’ve found your perfect tree—and I’m never letting you fall.
 You cling to my heart in the softest, most precious way, and I never want to imagine my life without you in it.

Happy 1-year anniversary, my love. I can’t wait for many more years with you—more memories, more love, more adventures, and more of everything that makes us us.

<p>I love you forever and always</p> 
— Yours, now and always apka Anish 💖
